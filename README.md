_A lighter implementation of [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/),
based on GTK3 + WebKit2_

## Idea

Previously known as *XMotor* (a Cordova-like project introduced during
[Working Off the Grid: HTML5 Offline -
DevFestParis2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI5HAduHOSk)), the
revival of this codebase comes from a [Dev.to
post](https://dev.to/yvansraka/kiss-alternatives-to-rn-electron-3935).
